This proposal is a subset of a [previous proposal](placeElement) covering APIs to allow live HTML elements.

## Motivation

There is no web API to easily render complex layouts of text and other content into a `<canvas>`. As a result, `<canvas>`-based content suffers in accessibilty, internationalization, performance and quality.

### Use cases

* **Styled, Laid Out Content in Canvas.** Thereâ€™s a strong need for better styled text support in Canvas. Examples include chart components (legend, axes, etc.), rich content boxes in creative tools, and in-game menus.
* **Accessibility Improvements.** There is currently no guarantee that the canvas fallback content currently used for `<canvas>` accessibility always matches the rendered content, and such fallback content can be hard to generate. With this API, elements drawn into the canvas bitmap will match their corresponding canvas fallback.
* **Composing HTML Elements with Shaders.** A limited set of CSS shaders, such as filter effects, are already available, but there is a desire to use general WebGL shaders with HTML.
* **HTML Rendering in a 3D Context.** 3D aspects of sites and games need to render rich 2D content into surfaces within a 3D scene.

## Proposed solution: `layoutsubtree`, `drawHTMLElement`, `texHTMLElement2D` and `setHitTestRegions`

* the `layoutsubtree` attribute on a `<canvas>` element allows its descendant elements to have layout (*), and causes the direct children of the `<canvas>` to have a stacking context and become a containing block for all descendants. Descendant elements of the `<canvas>` still do not paint or hit-test, and are not discovered by UA algorithms like find-in-page.
* The `CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawHTMLElement(element, x, y, options)` method renders `element` and its subtree into a 2D canvas at offset x and y, so long as `element` is a direct child of the `<canvas>`. It has no effect if `layoutsubtree` is not specified on the `<canvas>`. The `options` dictionary, if given, has a single option that preserves user privacy in the drawn content, allowing readback or use in WebGL.
* The `WebGLRenderingContext.texHTMLElement2D(..., element)` method renders `element` into a WebGL texture. It has no effect if `layoutsubtree` is not specified on the `<canvas>`.
* The `CanvasRenderingContext2D.setHitTestRegions([{element: ., rect: {x: x, y: y, width: ..., height: ...}, ...])` (and `WebGLRenderingContext.setHitTestRegions(...)`) API takes a list of elements and `<canvas>`-relative rects indicating where the
  element paints relative to the backing buffer of the canvas. These rects are then used to redirect hit tests for mouse and touch events automatically from the `<canvas>` element to the drawn element.

(*) Without `layoutsubtree`, geometry APIs such as `getBoundingClientRect()` on these elements return an empty rect. They do have computed styles, however, and are keyboard-focusable.

`drawHTMLElement(element ...)` takes the CTM (current transform matrix) of the canvas into consideration. The image drawn into the canvas is sized to `element`'s [`devicePixelContentBox`](https://web.dev/articles/device-pixel-content-box); element outsize that bounds (including ink and layout overflow) are clipped. The `drawHTMLElement(element, x, y, dwidth, dheight)` variant resizes the image of `element`'s subtree to `dwidth` and `dheight`.

In an addition, a `fireOnEveryPaint` option is added to `ResizeObserverOptions`, allowing script to be notified whenever the drawn elements might have changed their
DOM state and the canvas should be redrawn. The callback to the resize obsever will be called at resize obsever timing, which is after DOM style and layout, but before paint.

The same element may be drawn multiple times.

Once drawn, the resulting canvas image is static. Subsequent changes to the element will not be reflected in the canvas, so the element must be explicitly redrawn if an author wishes to see the changes.

The descendant elements of the `<canvas>` are considered fallback content used to provide accessibility information.
See [Issue#11](https://github.com/WICG/html-in-canvas/issues/11) for an ongoing discussion of accessibility concerns.

Offscreen canvas contexts and detached canvases are not supported because drawing DOM content when the canvas is not in the DOM poses technical challenges. See [Issue#2](https://github.com/WICG/html-in-canvas/issues/2) for further discussion.

**NOTE**: When using this feature in a DevTrial, take steps to avoid leaking private information, as privacy controls are still in-progress. The `allowReadback` option must be set to `true` when an untainted canvas is required; in this mode the content painted into the canvas skips all content which may reveal [PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data)). In WebGL rendering, content which may reveal PII is never painted. DevTrial users may wish to start using this option now to avoid disruption when tainting is enabled.

```idl
interface CanvasRenderingContext2D {

  ...

  dictionary Canvas2DDrawElementOption {
    boolean allowReadback = false; 
  };

  [RaisesException]
  void drawHTMLElement(Element element, unrestricted double x, unrestricted double y,
                       optional Canvas2DDrawElementOption options = {});

  [RaisesException]
  void drawHTMLElement(Element element, unrestricted double x, unrestricted double y,
                       unrestricted double dwidth, unrestricted double dheight,
                       optional Canvas2DDrawElementOption options = {});

```

```idl
interface WebGLRenderingContext {

  ...

  [RaisesException]
    void texHTMLElement2D(GLenum target, GLint level, GLint internalformat,
                          GLenum format, GLenum type, Element element);

```

## Demos

#### [See here](Examples/complex-text.html) to see an example of how to use the API. It should render like the following (the blue rectangle indicates the bounds of the `<canvas>`, and the black the element passed to
drawHTMLElement). It draws like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88d5200b-176c-4102-a4a0-f5893101b295)

#### [See here](Examples/webGL.html) for an example of how to use the WebGL `texHTMLElement2D` API to populate a GL texture with HTML content.
The example should render an animated cube, like in the following shapshot. Note how the border box fills the entire face of the cube.
To adjust that, modify the texture coordinates for rendering the cube and possibly adjust the texture wrap
parameters. Or, wrap the content in a larger `<div>` and draw the `<div>`.  It draws like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78606b3b-706c-4066-875b-c6245d7ef27f)

A demo of the same thing using an experimental extension of [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is [here](https://raw.githack.com/mrdoob/three.js/htmltexture/examples/webgl_materials_texture_html.html). Further instructions and context
are [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/31233).

#### [See here](Examples/text-input.html) for an example utilizing the `setHitTestRegions` and `fireOnEveryPaint` APIs to enable use of interactive elements like
`<input>` within a canvas. The output after clicking on the input element and typing in "my input" looks like this:

## Developer Trial (dev trial) Information
The HTML-in-Canvas features may be enabled by passing the `--enable-blink-features=CanvasDrawElement` to Chrome Canary versions later than 138.0.7175.0.

Notes for dev trial usage:
* The methods were recently renamed: `drawHTMLElement` was previously `drawElement` and `textHTMLElement2D` was formerly `texElement2D`. The rename will land shortly in Chrome Canary. The change was made at developers' request to avoid confusion with existing WebGL methods. The old names will continue to work until at least Chrome 145, but please start migrating content if at all possible.
* The features are currently under active development and changes to the API may happen at any time, though we make every effort to avoid unnecessary churn.
* The canvas is now tainted unless the `allowReadback` option is set true. Even then, not all personal information (PII) is currently protected, so take extreme care to avoid leaking PII in any demos. WebGL textures are always privacy preserving, though with the same caveats of incomplete protection at the time of writing.
* The space of possible HTML content is enormous and only a tiny fraction has been tested with `drawHTMLElement`.
* Interactive elements (such as links, forms or buttons) can be drawn into the canvas, but are not automatically interactive.

Other known limitations:
* Cross-origin iframes are not rendered

We are most interesting in feedback on the following topics:
* What content works, and what fails? Which failure modes are most important to fix?
* Is necessary support missing for some flavors of Canvas rendering contexts? 
* How does the feature interact with accessibility features? How can accessibility support be improved?
